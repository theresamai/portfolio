## Diving Headfirst into NodeBots Day

Hackathons and other similar events are greatly known for pushing people to their limits. They require interdisciplinary teams to craft a product within a few hours or a few days. Usually, people come to these events with some form of idea of what they're going to do or with some beneficial knowledge like programming or product design.   

Because of my love for robotics, I decided to go to my first hackathon like event, NodeBots Day. NodeBots Day is a day where people come together to manipulate the physical world with Javascript, and I decided to do something that scared me initially: I dived headfirst into it without knowing how to program in Javascript.  Because of my introductory programming classes, I have experience programming in C++ and C with Visual Studio and PuTTY, but it doesn't make up for the fact that I didn't know a bit of Javascript. Nonetheless, I decided to go to participate in this event to become a better problem solver and adapter.  

When we downloaded programs onto our laptops, I had to ask my neighbors and the staff a lot of questions. I was quite fortunate to have them guiding me through my first time downloading and navigating the programs needed for the event. In addition to that, I am grateful that I knew the basic UNIX commands already, so I was able to focus more on programming than navigating my computer.

After that, I moved on to the tutorials and joined Kishen Maloor, Christian Mello, and Danh Nguyen (who were really awesome by the way). The event had prepared tutorial code that enabled us to use Javascript to control LED lights, motors, and more, but first we needed to connect our Raspberry Pi to our laptops wirelessly. Unfortunately, the Raspberry Pi was unable to upload our code needed to send code wirelessly to it. We spent quite a bit of time troubleshooting and understanding where the code could have possibly gone wrong. Soon, we realized it's a hardware problem, and we had to replace our Raspberry Pi with another one. I remember spending my lunch, munching on a burrito as I try to upload the required code to our Raspberry Pi with success. I felt relieved as I told my group members that our Rasperry Pi can now accept code wirelessly.  

We then moved onto the next tutorials, and I soon learned that I was more helpful than I thought. While my team members cranked out code, I focused on wiring and troubleshooting the electronics on the Raspberry Pi with my knowledge of electronics from my engineering classes. With this set up, I was able to learn from my group's code while also teaching them electronics and wiring with the help of Kishen.  

Even though the event only lasted a few hours, I was very grateful for the experience. I was able to meet and connect with a few great people while also learning from them. In return, I was able to teach and support them as well. I am proud of the fact that I was able to help another group with the tutorials with the support of Danh. It shows that I was able to quickly learn something and be able to relay it to someone well.

With this experience in my belt, I cannot wait to go to a hackathon in the future. While waiting, I am going to push myself by learning more about electronics and programming. Also, shout out to Kishen, Christian, and Danh for being the best group a beginner can ask for! I really did learn a lot from you guys, and I hope to see you guys at similar events in the future.
