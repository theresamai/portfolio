# Truman Scholarship

The Truman Scholarship is a nationally competitive scholarship for aspiring public servants. As part of the application, a policy proposal is required to see the applicant's commitment to public service in their desired field. In my case, I've been always passionate about education policy, yet at the time, I did not know where to start. Intimidated, I decided to reach out to education policy expert Dr. Thompson who helped shine a light on the inequities of our education system. From this conversation, I realized that I am passionate about providing students the education they need for the "real world". 

I eventually decided on making financial literacy a high school requirement in Oregon, but I decided to shift gears to account for the fiscal impacts of the pandemic. By doing this, I focused more on creating a pilot program that will ensure rollout is simple, equitable, and impactful for high schoolers across the state. After many rounds of feedback by my scholarship advisors, mentors, and peers, I finally decided to submit my application, and guess what? I became Oregon State University's Truman nominee!

Although I ended up not becoming a finalist, I felt that the opportunity to push myself is one I will always be so grateful for. Plus, how can I be sad when I got a financial literacy bill in the Oregon House the following year?
