# Truman Scholarship

The Truman Scholarship is a nationally competitive scholarship for aspiring public servants. As part of the application, a policy proposal was required, and because of my passion for education policy, I decided to focus on financial literacy as a graduation requirement in Oregon high schools. Due to the pandemic, I decided to create a pilot program to ensure rollout is simple, efficent, and impactful. Fortunately, I was then selected to be Oregon State University's campus nominee for the Truman Scholarship.
