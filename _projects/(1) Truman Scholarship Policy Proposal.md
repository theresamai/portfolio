# Truman Scholarship

The Truman Scholarship is a nationally competitive scholarship for aspiring public servants. As part of the application, a policy proposal was required, and because of my passion for education policy, I decided to focus on financial literacy as a graduation requirement in Oregon high schools. Due to the pandemic, I decided to create a pilot program to ensure rollout is simple, efficent, and impactful. Fortunately, I was then selected to be Oregon State University's campus nominee for the Truman Scholarship.

## The Policy Proposal

To: Representative Teresa Alonso León
Office Held: Oregon State Representative - Chair of House Interim Committee On Education
Issue: Financial Literacy in K-12

### Problem Statement

The economic challenges posed by the pandemic remind us of how one financial mistake can mean dire consequences. Unfortunately, Oregonians were already in trouble before 2020 hit. In 2018, only 38% of adults were able to pass a basic financial literacy quiz, 48% did not save enough money for a rainy-day fund, and 53% did not have a savings plan for retirement (FINRA Investor Education Foundation, n.d.). Although there was an Oregon high school requirement in personal finance, it was later removed in 1997 due to a rapidly changing economy and a focus on core course content (Nielsen, 2009). Now, that perspective is changing: the majority of Oregon adults and students desire a high school diploma that best prepares them for success, especially when it comes to real-world skills (DHM Research, 2019; Ali et al., 2018). Even so, only 36% of Oregon students reported having completed at least one course on personal finance upon graduation (Ali et al., 2018).

#### Proposed Solution

By mandating financial education in our schools, we help decrease the likelihood of young adults facing debt and collections, while also increasing their credit scores (Urban et al., 2018). In addition, financial education helps individuals cultivate financial resilience and overcome their family’s financial struggles (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2020).

Understanding this, the Oregon Department of Education should enact a pilot program focused on mandating a personal finance course for high school graduation. To ensure the pilot understands the policy’s impact from all angles, the Oregon Department of Education should recruit several high schools including those that serve students who have been historically excluded from educational opportunities, such as communities of color and low-income and rural communities (Ruffenach & Worcel, 2017). As a result of this pilot, the state would better understand how to transition its schools to such a graduation requirement, especially when it comes to funding, training, and teaching.

#### Major Obstacles & Implementation Challenges

One major obstacle is funding, yet this pilot will have a minimal fiscal impact due to the number of schools involved and the ability to develop financial education at a low cost. For example, in Virginia, financial institutions and local nonprofits helped develop curriculum and standards for free, and in Florida, professional development was only $150 per teacher (Rosenbaum, 2020). Understanding that, Oregon can gain such support from members of the state treasury’s Financial Education Advisory Team.
Another challenge is that a personal finance mandate will divert focus from core subjects also required for graduation. Even so, many Oregon high schools teach personal finance already on an elective basis, and this course could be applied to high school graduation requirements in mathematics, social studies, or career and technical education. Knowing this, personal finance, while providing an important life skill, would also help students make progress towards graduation.
