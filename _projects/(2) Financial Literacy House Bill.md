# Financial Literacy House Bill

Since I have worked as a volunteer reader, academic coach, and a college access mentor, it made sense that I was a part of the Willamette Valley Legislative Fellowship's education policy group. Here, we were able to develop our own policy concept, yet this is where the struggles reside. Even though we were four students from local high schools and colleges, we had drastically different policy ideas we each were passionate about. For example, we have made a laundry list, which included financial support for international students, civics education for all, and college access resources. Even so, we had to pare down, so we submitted our proposed solutions focusing on college access, CTE, life skills, and financial literacy.

We then encountered into another problem: What should we focus on? After a long Zoom debate, our team decided on choosing a policy concept based on making an impact, not on its feasibility to pass in our fellowship. Knowing this, we chose financial literacy due to seeing our graduates lacking the skills they need to succeed, especially during the onset of the pandemic.

Soon, our team members started meeting key stakeholders, which included high school teachers, Stand for Children, the Oregon Education Association, and the Oregon Department of Education. By meeting with a variety of groups, we started noticing the dynamics within education policy, such as the understanding that when you *add* something, you need to *take away* something from the curriculum. Another finding is that there is an emphasis on giving teachers leeway, especially in what and how they teach. By not doing so, a mandate can seem like a breach of local control. Finally, it is startling to see the lack of student involvement in the policy realm. Although there are great advocacy organizations such as Oregon Student Association and Oregon Student Voice, there is a need to see more students in our policymaking process, especially those from historically underserved communities.

Eventually, we developed a one-pager for our policy concept, where we were able to explain our policy problem, our solution, its benefits, and its fiscal impact. Although it was not a one pager (it was two pages), we were able to get great feedback from Jack Lehman, a staffer of Representative Rayfield. From him, we learned of how we need to make our one pager simpler while still leaving folks with the information they need about our policy concept. As a result, our team did our best in wordsmithing our one pager in addition to including key endorsements to show support for our policy. Being a design critique, I also changed up the formatting of our one pager to look more clean.

We then focused on the last part of the fellowship, where we present and sell our policy concept in front of a panel of state representatives. Here, our group collaborated on a presentation that seeks to use a narrative approach in showing how financial education is as important as ever. More specifically, we had Caroline Gao start us off by explaining how Oregonians are not financially literate and what that means for high schoolers like her. We then shifted more towards our policy concept and how it can be a key benefit to our livelihoods. Luckily, our approach worked! Caroline received best speaker out of all of our cohort, our policy concept was deemed the best, and I received kudos for my hard work in the program.

In 2021, our policy concept turned into House Bill 3232 for the 2021 Oregon session. Unfortunately, due to the Republicans delaying the session, our bill died in the House Education Committee.
