# Social Media Management for Oregon Wild

As an intern at Oregon Wild, my main job is to support our wildlife efforts through community engagement. 
This includes managing, monitoring, and maintaining our Facebook page called Oregon's Wolves & Wildlife, which has over 16,000 followers.

Because I want to leave my internship with a sustainable workload for my boss, I decided on posting three times per week with a variety of content.
For example, in a typical week, I could do a fun post on Monday, an advocacy post on Wednesday, and an educational post on Friday.
Once in a while, I would break from this patten if there is breaking news such as the delisting of the gray wolves or the worsening of the Bootleg Fire.

Either way, I always seek to find a way to engage our Oregon community as they are, especially when it comes to wildlife. Below are several of my own social media posts in chronological order.
