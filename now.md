## Personally
I am living in Portland, Oregon, enjoying the sun, with the occassional trip down in Corvallis for school, research, speech and debate, and University Legislative Scholars! 
Yet, because of the pandemic, I am finding lots of time to focus on myself, so 
I am trying to read more books, listen to more podcasts, and watch more movies.
Currently, I am reading *What You Should Know About Politics ... But Don't*,
and I am listening to *Up First*, *OPB Politics*, *Freakonomics*, and *538 Politics*.
In addition to this, I am starting to explore the state of Oregon and get into nature journaling.

## Professionally
Currently, I am finishing my internship with Oregon Wild, and then, I will be back in the Oregon State Legislature as the legislative intern under Rep. Ricki Ruiz.
I am also working on a research project, which may go the educational psychology or social psychology route, but we'll see when the term starts! 

## News
* 8/25/2021: I will be serving as a member of the Multnomah County Charter Review Commission. I'm so excited!
* 8/11/2021: As a 2021 member of the NEW Leadership Oregon cohort, I look forward for the cohort retreat in September. Fingers crossed that it can be in person. If not, it is still a great opportunity to be around many amazing people. :blush:
* 5/7/2021: Just received news that I will be one of six peer leaders for the upcoming University Legislative Scholars cohort. :tada:
