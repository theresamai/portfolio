# What I'm Focused On Now
Credit: Derek Silvers

## Personally
I am living in Corvallis, Oregon, enjoying the sun! 
Yet, because of the pandemic, I am finding that I magically have time to focus on myself. 
Knowing this, I am currently trying to read more books, listen to more podcasts, and watch more movies.
Currently, I am reading *What You Should Know About Politics ... But Don't*,
and I am listening to Up First, OPB Politics, Freakonomics, and 538 Politics.
In addition to this, I am also learning hip hop dance for the first time in years, and I am learning how to cook (as long as my lactose intolerant self can handle it)!

## Professionally
For this year, I am honored to be an intern for State Representative Ricki Ruiz, where I get to track legislation, research bills, and develop my own town hall. 
On the side, I am also developing a policy memo for a public official as an Oregon State University Legislative Scholar, and I will be soon a minutes contractor for the City of Corvallis!

## News
* 4/16/2022: I am going to be a minutes contractor for the City of Corvallis! As a policy wonk, I am so excited to observe a local government in action, and I look forward to joining Corvallis' awesome team. :tada:
