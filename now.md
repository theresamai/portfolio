## Personally
I am living in Corvallis, Oregon, enjoying the sun! 
Yet, because of the pandemic, I am finding lots of time to focus on myself, so 
I am trying to read more books, listen to more podcasts, and watch more movies.
Currently, I am reading *What You Should Know About Politics ... But Don't*,
and I am listening to *Up First*, *OPB Politics*, *Freakonomics*, and *538 Politics*.
In addition to this, I am learning hip hop dance after a long hiatus, and I am learning how to cook without causing chaos!

## Professionally
For this year, I am honored to be an intern for State Representative Ricki Ruiz, where I get to track legislation, research bills, and develop my own town hall. 
On the side, I am currently developing a policy memo for a public official as an Oregon State University Legislative Scholar, and I am also a minutes contractor for the City of Corvallis!

## News
* 4/31/2021: I accepted an internship offer with Oregon Wild for the summer and Rep. Ruiz for the interim (fall). As someone with a soft spot for conservation, I am so excited to get into wildlife protections and return to the Ruiz team for the upcoming legislative session! :owl:
* 4/16/2021: I am going to be a minutes contractor for the City of Corvallis starting May! As a policy wonk, I am so excited to observe a local government in action, and I look forward to joining Corvallis' awesome team. :tada:
* 3/15/2021: I am starting my legislative internship with State Representative Ricki Ruiz for this long session. Having worked with the representative and his staff on the campaign trail, I am excited about what this team will do! :muscle:
