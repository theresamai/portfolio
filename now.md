## Personally
I am living in Portland, Oregon, with the occassional trip down in Corvallis for school. 
Because of the pandemic, I am finding lots of time to focus on myself, so 
I am trying to read more books, listen to more podcasts, and watch more movies.
Currently, I am reading *What You Should Know About Politics ... But Don't*,
and I am listening to *Up First*, *OPB Politics*, *Freakonomics*, and *538 Politics*.
In addition to this, I am starting to explore the state of Oregon and get into nature journaling, which I am absolutely in love with!

## Professionally
I am back in the Oregon State Legislature as the sole legislative intern under Rep. Ricki Ruiz. In addition, I am enjoying my time as a peer leader for the University Legislative Scholars program and a committee member for the Multnomah County Charter Review!

## News
* 8/25/2021: I will be serving as a member of the Multnomah County Charter Review Commission. I'm so excited!
* 8/11/2021: As a 2021 member of the NEW Leadership Oregon cohort, I look forward for the cohort retreat in September. Fingers crossed that it can be in person. If not, it is still a great opportunity to be around many amazing people. :blush:
