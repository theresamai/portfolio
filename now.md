# What I'm Focused On Now
Credit: Derek Silvers

## Personally
I am living in Corvallis, Oregon, enjoying the sun! 
I am currently reading *What You Should Know About Politics ... But Don't*,
and I am listening to Up First, OPB Politics, Freakonomics, 538 Politics, and The Weeds.
On the side, I am also learning hip hop dance for the first time in years!

## Professionally
For this legislative session, I am honored to be an intern for State Representative Ricki Ruiz, where I get to track legislation, research bills, and develop my own town hall. 
In addition to this, I am an Oregon State University Legislative Scholar, where I get to develop a policy memo for an Oregon public official, and I recently got the news that I will be a minutes contractor for the City of Corvallis!
